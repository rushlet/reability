  <section class="main FAQ">
    <p>Back pain is a common complaint. 80% of us will have back pain at some point in our lives. Mostly back pain is
      nothing to worry about and will pass in a number of weeks. This doesn't stop it being painful, annoying,
      frustrating
      and worrisome.</p>
    <p>If you cut your finger you can see it, you have probably cut yourself before, you know what is going to happen.
      It
      hurts, but you are not worried, you might have to avoid doing some things for a bit. You watch it heal. Before it
      is
      fully healed it stops hurting. You forget and try doing up a button and remember again. You do up the button in an
      awkward manner for a few weeks. All is normal.</p>
    <p>If you hurt your back, you can't see it. It might not have happened before. Suddenly you can't do something that
      seems fundamental like bending over. You take the day off work. You worry. Will I ever be able to put my socks on
      without pain again? You can't see it heal. Mostly before it is fully healed the pain goes away. You forget about
      it.
      One morning you are putting your socks on in a rush and remember again. You put your socks on slowly for a while.
      This is normal, but sometimes it doesn't work this way and you may need some advice, reassurance or treatment to
      help resolve the problem.</p>
    <p>Below I have answered a few questions you may have. If in doubt seek expert advice. Here at Reability we are
      always
      ready to listen to you. We can help understand where you are at the moment and how to help you proceed with your
      life especially if the pain has been with you for too long.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>Is my back pain cancer</summary>
            <p>A small number, < 1%, of people who have back pain have a definite pathological cause of their back pain.
                For example a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection1 Cancer is the smallest fraction of that
                proportion. If you have metastatic cancer or a past history of lung, breast, prostate, gastrointestinal
                or thyroid cancer it increases your chances of the back pain you are feeling being caused by cancer.
                </p> <p>Although a number of cancers do not have any signs or
                symptoms. Some indications that you could have cancer include feeling unusually tired, loss of weight,
                loss of
                appetite, feeling nauseous or vomiting.</p>
            <p>If you are feeling any of these symptoms you should consult a specialist,
              especially if the symptoms have been getting worse over a period of time.</p>

            <summary>Is back pain my kidneys</summary>
            <p>Your kidneys are quite high up on either side of your back, protected by the lower couple of ribs and a
              layer of
              fat. They help filter your blood and regulate your blood pressure.</p>
            <p>Kidney infections are quite rare 2-4 people per 10,000 people each year in one study2. The pain normally
              won't be
              affected by the position you are in or who you move. You could have a kidney infection if you have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One sided pain that is dull and constant</li>
              <li>A recent urinary tract infection.</li>
              <li>Aches in your body, a temperature and tiredness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Kidney stones are when a solid piece of material, most often a calcium salt, forms in the kidney. These
              can start to
              cause pain as they move out of the kidney. This pain is described as more of a sharp pain and will most
              likely be
              one sided. About 3.5% of people in Scotland have kidney stones.3 One of the 2018 Ig nobel prizes was for
              research
              into whether roller coasters could aid in the passing of kidney stones4,, but it is not accepted medical
              practice.

            <summary>Is my back pain a muscle or disc</summary>
            <p>We don't know. Really. Hear me out.</p>
            <p>There are many definitions of pain. One recent one is that</p>
            <p>“Pain is a distressing experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage with sensory,
              emotional,
              cognitive and social components"</p>
            <p>Another one I like is "Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the
              experiencing
              person say it does"</p>
            <p>One of the implications of this is that pain does not mean that there is necessarily and damage to a
              tissue in the
              body. There are receptors in the tissues, called nociceptors, that are part of the danger signalling
              system of the
              body. These along with our thoughts, beliefs, how well we are rested, how stressed we are and lots of
              other factors
              go into our central nervous system which decides how to respond. If the central nervous system decides
              there is
              potential danger one of the outputs could be pain. Other outputs could be to do with our immune system or
              simply
              moving out of danger. When there is a physical accident, tissue damage can cause pain, and it could be a
              muscle or a
              disc or any of the other tissues in the back that have nociceptors. If the pain has come on for no
              apparent reason,
              other factors could be contributing to the pain. This can be frustrating as a patient as we like to know
              what is
              wrong and a pulled muscle is easier to grasp than something like, you haven't been sleeping, you are
              worried about
              your mother, stressed at your job, you've inherited your aunts back, combined with sitting funny at a
              meeting the
              other day and just getting over a cold all of which have made you more prone to feeling pain and any one
              of those
              factors could tip you 'over the line' into feeling pain.</p>

            <summary>Do I need a new mattress</summary>
            If you daily wake up in pain and your symptoms slowly recover during the day. It might be good to consider
            your
            sleeping arrangements. Especially if you feel relief when you are on holiday or visiting friends. Although
            having
            holidays and being with people you love generally has a positive effect on how we experience pain (see
            above) so try
            not to expect a single external factor to solve all your issues.
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do I need an MRI for my back pain</summary>
            <p>Humans are really clever and we look for patterns and causes whenever we can. We are developing better
              and better
              ways to see smaller and more detailed parts of the world and our bodies. When MRI was first developed only
              people in
              severe pain were scanned as it was an expensive procedure. When we looked at the images we found a number
              of things
              that we thought could be causing the pain. Disc degeneration, bulges and protrusions or facet joint
              degeneration. As
              time has gone on and more people who do not have symptoms have been scanned we have discovered that these
              'findings'
              are not the diagnostic miracle we at first thought. Below is a table from a research paper that collated
              reports of
              these pain free individuals and what they found.</p>

            <p>If those percentages look scarily high, remember these are people that did not have any symptoms, no
              pain, no aches,
              no shooting pains into their legs. It looks like more that half of us have signs of disc degeneration by
              the time we
              are 30. The words 'disc degeneration' sound scary don't they? If you look at your face, do you have any
              wrinkles? Do
              they hurt? Maybe what we have called disc degeneration on MRI scans are just like wrinkles on the inside.
              Your disc
              when you are 60 doesn't look like your disc when you are 20, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't work. I
              don't
              think that MRIs have that much use for most cases of back pain. If you have a scan and it says that you
              have some
              scary sounding finding, maybe it's just a little wrinkle.</p>

            <summary>Why is my back pain worse at night</summary>
            <p>There are a number of reasons your back pain may be worse at night. It may be that when you are lying
              down the shift
              in gravity is pulling on tissues around your spine differently aggravating your symptoms or you are
              putting pressure
              on an area that is sensitive.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is just that nothing else is going on and so your focus is drawn towards the pain and it
              takes up most
              of your attention.</p>
            <p>There are a few serious reasons why you might have back pain at night. Spinal tumours have been known to
              cause night
              pain. Spinal tumours are rare, the biggest risk factor is if you have previously had cancer. Ankylosing
              spondylitis
              can affect the joints in your lower back and pelvis and often causes night pain. Osteomyelitis (a type of
              bone
              infection) can be worse at night. This is normally accompanied by a high temperature as well as local
              swelling and
              redness. If you think you might have any of these seek medical advice.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Is my back pain Ankylosing spondylitis</summary>
            Ankylosing spondylitis the words are derived from Greek and relate to hardening or immobility of the spine
            together
            with inflammation. It is one of several associated conditions that are known collectively as
            spondyloarthritis. If
            you are under about 35, the pain has come on slowly, you get no relief from rest or exercise or you get back
            pain at
            night that is better when if you get up and move around you may have one of the forms of spondyloarthritis.
            Other
            symptoms could be psoriasis, finger swelling, eye inflammation, tendon issues or gut problems. Often the
            pain
            responds to ibuprofen, naproxin, diclofenic or other Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID).

            <summary>Back pain during my Period</summary>
            <p>People often feel back pain during their period. The uterus isn't in the back, but some of the nerves
              that supply it
              go to the spine. As all nerve impulses are electrical signals when the signals reach the spine sometimes
              they
              converge with nerves from other parts of the body and we feel the symptoms in places other than where the
              signal is
              coming from. This is called 'referred pain'</p>
            <p>However, your back pain could be endometriosis. When tissue that acts like tissue from the uterine wall
              is present
              in other parts of the body it still responds to the hormones that control the menstrual cycle which can
              cause an
              inflammatory reaction that cycles regularly. Other signs of endometriosis include: painful intercourse,
              pain on
              going to the toilet, excessive bleeding, fatigue, and nausea. All that coincide with your menstrual cycle.

            <summary>Do I need to see a doctor for my back pain?</summary>
            <p>Most of us will get back pain at some time in our lives. It is often very painful. However, it is not
              often
              dangerous, in which case, seeking pain relief and doing gentle movements can be enough.
              Although watching your favourite comedy or talking to your best friend may also help.</p>
            <ul>
              There are a few things to look out for that mean you should seek help immediately.
              <li>If you begin to lose control of your bowel or bladder.</li>
              <li>If you think that you have fractured part of your spine. This normally only happens in response to a
                trauma.</li>
              <li>If you have reason to suspect it might be cancer. Most usually in older people how have previously had
                cancer
                somewhere else.</li>
              <li>If you feel unwell and have a fever or chills</li>

            <summary>Why is my back pain worse in the morning?</summary>
            <p>Like most things to do with back pain, pinning it down to one thing is rarely possible. Sometimes when we
              wake up a
              bit stiff it takes a while to get everything moving again. If you currently have back pain this can mean
              that the
              morning ‘stiffness’ becomes morning pain which eases as the back pain eases. Some people find a hot bath
              in the
              morning can help.</p>
            <p>Some inflammatory conditions, like ankylosing spondylitis, are more active towards the end of the night
              and so we
              can wake early with back pain. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can also give symptoms in the
              morning.</p>
            <p>Is your mattress uncomfortable?</p>
            <p>Pain is a complicated thing to understand and many things can contribute to it. Including stress, sleep,
              diet, how
              much you exercise, what you believe, and what you expect to happen. Can you think of anything that you can
              change
              for the better? Vitamin D or B12 deficiency can make us more prone to bone pain. If you live without much
              sunlight,
              getting enough vitamin D can be a problem. If you are vegan, or have issues with your digestion, vitamin
              B12 can be
              deficient.</p>

            <summary>Is my back pain arthritis?</summary>
            <p>The word arthritis comes from the Greek for swollen joint. There are various processes that can cause
              swollen
              joints. The ones you will hear most are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
            </p>
            <p>Osteoarthritis is when the cartilage, which is the slippery surface of the bones in your joints, does not
              replenish
              itself as well as it used to. Osteoarthritis can cause pain and stiffness especially in the morning, but
              does not
              cause the joint to become hot and red. The best thing for osteoarthritis is movement. Start slowly and
              build up over
              time. If you would like guidance <a href="./contact.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
            <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a body wide disorder, which can cause swelling in your joints as well as other
              symptoms
              including fever and fatigue. Most commonly it affects your hands, wrists, and feet although it can affect
              the spine.
              The pain is described as throbbing or aching and is often worse first thing in the morning. Rheumatoid
              arthritis is
              managed and slowed by medication. If you think you have rheumatoid arthritis speak to your doctor.</p>

            <summary>What to do at home if you have back pain.</summary>
            The general advice is to keep moving and go about your day as much as you can. If pain is preventing you
            from doing
            this then cut back to what you can manage. Initially this may mean staying at home. Back pain can be very
            painful
            and last for weeks. While you are recovering try and find ways to move your body that don’t aggravate your
            symptoms
            and do them as much as you can.

            <summary>What exercises to do for back pain?</summary>
            <p>In the long term one of the best things to do to prevent back pain is some form of exercise. There is not
              one form
              of exercise that is better than another, so find something you enjoy and can fit into your life regularly.
              If you are currently experiencing low back pain try these movements.
              If they don’t hurt or don’t make anything worse do them often.
              If they hurt, try them with an open curious attitude every couple of days to see what happens.</p>
            <ul>
              While standing:
              <li>Bend over as if you are going to touch your toes</li>
              <li>Run your right hand down the outside of your right thigh</li>
              <li>Run your left hand down the outside of your left thigh</li>
              <li>Turn your upper body and shoulders to look over your right shoulder</li>
              <li>Turn your upper body and shoulders to look over your left shoulder</li>
              If nothing improves: seek help.

            <summary>Why do I have back pain when breathing in.</summary>
            <p> Two main things happen when we breath. The diaphragm contracts and pushes down into our abdomen and our
              ribs flare
              outwards and upwards slightly. Both of these things increase the space in our chest to bring air into our
              lungs.
              The ribs come from the spine to the breast bone. All the way for the lower middle part of our back up to
              the bottom
              of our neck. If the pain you are feeling is in that area and also hurts when you cough, laugh or sneeze it
              might be
              a rib that is affected.</p>
            <p>The diaphragm is a broad flat muscle that divides the chest area that contains our heart and lungs from
              the abdomen
              that has all our organs of digestion in. As we breathe in, the pressure in the abdomen increases. If there
              is an
              issue with one of your abdominal organs breathing may aggravate it. Mostly we feel issues with our
              abdominal organs
              as an ill defined pain at the front of our bodies. However, as the nerves that supply the organs come from
              the back
              sometimes we can feel symptoms there.</p>
