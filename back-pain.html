    <h2>Back Pain FAQs</h2>

      <summary>How do shoulders work?</summary>
        Shoulders work mainly by muscle. The only bony attachment between your shoulder complex and the rest of your
        body is through your collar bone. This allows your arm to move in lots of different directions. Luckily muscles are well
        supplied with nutrients and nerves, which means they are more able to heal or change if anything goes wrong.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How do shoulders move?</summary>
        <p>
          The shoulder is made up of two main parts: your shoulder blade (also known as the scapula) and your glenohumeral joint, which is where the bone at the top of your arm meets the shoulder blade at the top corner of your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glenohumeral joint is a ‘ball and socket’ joint. The bone at the top of arm (humerus) is the ‘ball’ and
          the glenoid fossa of your shoulder blade is the ‘socket’. This joint can move in a lot of directions and can also
          rotate.
        </p>
        <p>
          What limits the movement of the shoulder joint is mainly the other parts of the body.
          The shoulder blade assists and stabilises the movement of the bone at the top of your arm. It sits at a slight
          angle being more forward as you move away from the spine. The shoulder blade moves up, down, left and right along
          the back of the rib cage. It also rotates on the rib cage as you lift your arm up and down.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What muscles are in the shoulder?</summary>
        The shoulder is magnificently complicated. There are 17 muscles that attach to the shoulder blade and a few
        others that help move the shoulder that attach to other parts of the body (including the pectoralis major and
        subclavius muscles). Each of these muscles plays a role in moving our arm around. If there is an issue with one
        muscle the others compensate for the loss, which is great in the short term, but can cause problems in the long
        term if not addressed.

      <summary>What is the rotator cuff?</summary>
        The rotator cuff is a name given to four muscles that attach from your shoulder blade to the ball at the top of
        your arm. These muscles have Latin names and slightly different functions but one way of thinking about them is
        that they are small muscles that hold your arm in place while the big muscles that overlie them do the heavy
        lifting.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What is a rotator cuff tear?</summary>
        <p>When muscles are damaged, due to activities that they are not able to cope with, it is called a strain. Often
          this occurs after catching yourself from falling or falling on an outstretched arm. In a bad strain some of
          the muscle fibres are broken or torn. Muscle strains are classified according to how bad they are. A grade 1
          strain affects few muscle fibres and you don’t generally experience any loss of strength through the muscle. A
          grade 2 strain affects up to half of the muscle, and will usually involve some swelling, pain and loss of
          strength. A grade 3 strain is when a muscle is completely broken. As well as pain and swelling a significant
          loss of movement is likely.</p>
          <p>
            As we age it is more likely that a small tear in our rotator cuff muscles can be found on an ultrasound or
            MRI scan. This tear may not be giving you any pain. If you are experiencing pain, and would like some
            advice, book an appointment with me.

      <summary>What does a rotator cuff injury feel like?</summary>
        This will depend on which muscles you have damaged, how badly you have damaged them and how you feel about it.
        Everyone’s pain experience is unique and can be affected by many factors outside of what has happened to the
        muscle. We often feel pain around the outside edge of the shoulder, even when this is not the site of injury.
        You are more likely to feel better if you are treated quickly and professionally than if you are unsure of what
        is going on and worry about the injury.

      <summary>What is frozen shoulder?</summary>
        Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is when something happens to the tissues surrounding your
        shoulder joint causing them to contract and become less flexible. The shoulder becomes stiff and painful with
        reduced movement in all directions. It often comes on for no apparent reason but may be associated with a minor
        injury. There is a strong link between diabetes and frozen shoulder.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What to do about frozen shoulder?</summary>
        It used to be thought that a frozen shoulder has a ‘natural progression’ and that there was nothing to be done
        but wait for it to pass. It is now understood that we can speed up that process and reduce the pain by engaging
        in different movements and exercises. We may sometimes think we have a frozen shoulder, when really we have a
        stiff painful shoulder. A stiff and painful shoulder is easier to deal with than frozen shoulder. Get in touch
        if you would like to know more.

      <summary>What is shoulder impingement?</summary>
        Shoulder impingement is the name given a collection of symptoms including pain, weakness or loss or movement in
        the shoulder. A sign of shoulder impingement is experiencing pain as we raise our arm to the side, from around
        60 degrees to 120 degrees. This is called a painful arc. Originally it was thought that shoulder impingement was
        caused by a muscle tendon rubbing against a bone at the top of the shoulder. This is not always the case and
        many factors can contribute to the pain that we feel in our shoulder. If you have been offered surgery for your
        shoulder impingement, but want to try something else first, get in touch.

      <summary>What is bursitis of the shoulder?</summary>
        A bursa is an area in a joint that allows muscles to move freely against themselves and other parts of the body
        like bone or ligament. Occasionally a bursa can get inflamed, which will often cause it to swell and feel hot.
        Because of this swelling in an enclosed space any movement around the area can cause symptoms. Cold can
        sometimes feel nice if applied to the area.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What is tendonitis in the shoulder?</summary>
        Tendonitis is a term originally used for an inflamed tendon. A tendon is what a muscle turns into before it
        attaches to a bone. In pictures of muscles, the tendon is the white bit at each end of the red muscle belly.
        Tendons tend to become irritable at the points where they turn from muscle to tendon or from tendon to bone.
        Tendonitis is a term used when the tendon part of your muscle is causing your issue. The tendon may not be
        inflamed, but may still be giving you symptoms. In order to heal properly tendons need to be loaded regularly to
        help align the cartilage fibres on the tendon. However too much load will slow the healing process, so a balance
        is needed. If you would like advice on a tendon issue book an appointment with me in Prestwick.

      <summary>What is a dislocated shoulder?</summary>
        A dislocated shoulder is when the bone that is at the top of your arm comes away from the shallow socket of bone
        in which it normally sits. Outside of certain genetic conditions a dislocation is normally the result of a
        trauma. The arm bone is most often displaced forward of its usual place and the shoulder will look deformed. If
        it has happened once it is more likely to happen again. Some people can move the bone in and out of place
        themselves. There are several nerves around the joint that can potentially be compromised when the humerus is
        put back in place so, if it is the first time this has happened to you, seek help to return the bone into its
        socket.
