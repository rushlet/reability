                This document refers to personal data, which is defined as information concerning any living person (a

            <p>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is EU wide and far more extensive than its
                predecessor the Data
                Protection Act, along with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), seek to protect
                and enhance
                the
                rights of EU data subjects. These rights cover the safeguarding of personal data, protection against the
                unlawful
                processing of personal data and the unrestricted movement of personal data within the EU and its storage
                within the
                EEA.
