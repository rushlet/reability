    <p>Shoulders are brilliant. They need to be strong to move our arms around, stable so that we can carry heavy
      loads
      and yet flexible enough to reach into those awkward places. We don’t notice all the work they are doing
      until
      something goes wrong. Below are a few answers to the question, what is going on with my shoulder?
    </p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Shoulder pain exercies</h2>
    <p>
      There are lots of different ways to challenge your shoulder. What you need will depend on what has happened
      and what you are used to doing. Here are a couple of gentle introductory movements you can try.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pendulum exercise helps you relax the muscles of the shoulder blade and gets some extra movement into your
      joint.

    <p>
      This video shows how you can gently activate the muscles around your joint without stressing them too much,
      which
      can be
      good if they are sensitive at the moment.

      <h2>Common questions about shoulder pain</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>How do shoulders work?</summary>
        Shoulders work mainly by muscle. The only bony attachment between your shoulder complex and the rest of your
        body is through your collar bone. This allows your arm to move in lots of different directions. Luckily muscles
        are well
        supplied with nutrients and nerves, which means they are more able to heal or change if anything goes wrong.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do shoulders move?</summary>
        <p>
          The shoulder is made up of two main parts: your shoulder blade (also known as the scapula) and your
          glenohumeral joint, which is where the bone at the top of your arm meets the shoulder blade at the top corner
          of your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glenohumeral joint is a ‘ball and socket’ joint. The bone at the top of arm (humerus) is the ‘ball’ and
          the glenoid fossa of your shoulder blade is the ‘socket’. This joint can move in a lot of directions and can
          also
          rotate.
        </p>
        <p>
          What limits the movement of the shoulder joint is mainly the other parts of the body.
          The shoulder blade assists and stabilises the movement of the bone at the top of your arm. It sits at a slight
          angle being more forward as you move away from the spine. The shoulder blade moves up, down, left and right
          along
          the back of the rib cage. It also rotates on the rib cage as you lift your arm up and down.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What muscles are in the shoulder?</summary>
        The shoulder is magnificently complicated. There are 17 muscles that attach to the shoulder blade and a few
        others that help move the shoulder that attach to other parts of the body (including the pectoralis major and
        subclavius muscles). Each of these muscles plays a role in moving our arm around. If there is an issue with one
        muscle the others compensate for the loss, which is great in the short term, but can cause problems in the long
        term if not addressed.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the rotator cuff?</summary>
        The rotator cuff is a name given to four muscles that attach from your shoulder blade to the ball at the top of
        your arm. These muscles have Latin names and slightly different functions but one way of thinking about them is
        that they are small muscles that hold your arm in place while the big muscles that overlie them do the heavy
        lifting.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is a rotator cuff tear?</summary>
        <p>When muscles are damaged, due to activities that they are not able to cope with, it is called a strain. Often
          this occurs after catching yourself from falling or falling on an outstretched arm. In a bad strain some of
          the muscle fibres are broken or torn. Muscle strains are classified according to how bad they are. A grade 1
          strain affects few muscle fibres and you don’t generally experience any loss of strength through the muscle. A
          grade 2 strain affects up to half of the muscle, and will usually involve some swelling, pain and loss of
          strength. A grade 3 strain is when a muscle is completely broken. As well as pain and swelling a significant
          loss of movement is likely.</p>
        <p>
          As we age it is more likely that a small tear in our rotator cuff muscles can be found on an ultrasound or
          MRI scan. This tear may not be giving you any pain. If you are experiencing pain, and would like some
          advice, book an appointment with me.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What does a rotator cuff injury feel like?</summary>
        This will depend on which muscles you have damaged, how badly you have damaged them and how you feel about it.
        Everyone’s pain experience is unique and can be affected by many factors outside of what has happened to the
        muscle. We often feel pain around the outside edge of the shoulder, even when this is not the site of injury.
        You are more likely to feel better if you are treated quickly and professionally than if you are unsure of what
        is going on and worry about the injury.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is frozen shoulder?</summary>
        Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is when something happens to the tissues surrounding your
        shoulder joint causing them to contract and become less flexible. The shoulder becomes stiff and painful with
        reduced movement in all directions. It often comes on for no apparent reason but may be associated with a minor
        injury. There is a strong link between diabetes and frozen shoulder.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What to do about frozen shoulder?</summary>
        It used to be thought that a frozen shoulder has a ‘natural progression’ and that there was nothing to be done
        but wait for it to pass. It is now understood that we can speed up that process and reduce the pain by engaging
        in different movements and exercises. We may sometimes think we have a frozen shoulder, when really we have a
        stiff painful shoulder. A stiff and painful shoulder is easier to deal with than frozen shoulder. Get in touch
        if you would like to know more.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is shoulder impingement?</summary>
        Shoulder impingement is the name given a collection of symptoms including pain, weakness or loss or movement in
        the shoulder. A sign of shoulder impingement is experiencing pain as we raise our arm to the side, from around
        60 degrees to 120 degrees. This is called a painful arc. Originally it was thought that shoulder impingement was
        caused by a muscle tendon rubbing against a bone at the top of the shoulder. This is not always the case and
        many factors can contribute to the pain that we feel in our shoulder. If you have been offered surgery for your
        shoulder impingement, but want to try something else first, get in touch.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is bursitis of the shoulder?</summary>
        A bursa is an area in a joint that allows muscles to move freely against themselves and other parts of the body
        like bone or ligament. Occasionally a bursa can get inflamed, which will often cause it to swell and feel hot.
        Because of this swelling in an enclosed space any movement around the area can cause symptoms. Cold can
        sometimes feel nice if applied to the area.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is tendonitis in the shoulder?</summary>
        Tendonitis is a term originally used for an inflamed tendon. A tendon is what a muscle turns into before it
        attaches to a bone. In pictures of muscles, the tendon is the white bit at each end of the red muscle belly.
        Tendons tend to become irritable at the points where they turn from muscle to tendon or from tendon to bone.
        Tendonitis is a term used when the tendon part of your muscle is causing your issue. The tendon may not be
        inflamed, but may still be giving you symptoms. In order to heal properly tendons need to be loaded regularly to
        help align the cartilage fibres on the tendon. However too much load will slow the healing process, so a balance
        is needed. If you would like advice on a tendon issue book an appointment with me in Prestwick.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is a dislocated shoulder?</summary>
        A dislocated shoulder is when the bone that is at the top of your arm comes away from the shallow socket of bone
        in which it normally sits. Outside of certain genetic conditions a dislocation is normally the result of a
        trauma. The arm bone is most often displaced forward of its usual place and the shoulder will look deformed. If
        it has happened once it is more likely to happen again. Some people can move the bone in and out of place
        themselves. There are several nerves around the joint that can potentially be compromised when the humerus is
        put back in place so, if it is the first time this has happened to you, seek help to return the bone into its
        socket.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is calcific tendonitis?</summary>
        Calcific tendonitis is where a small amount of calcium forms in your shoulder muscle and causes pain and
        irritation.
        The
        deposits are normally less than 2cm and usually occur in people in their 40s. There is some association with
        diabetes.
        The deposits do not always cause symptoms and can resolve of their own accord, although often the stage when the
        calcium
        is being reabsorbed is the most symptomatic.

        <summary>Shoulder pain exercises, how to work out shoulder?</summary>
        The benefits of exercise are numerous. It can make us stronger, give us more endurance, improve mood, and boost
        our
        immune system. Depending upon what sort of exercise you enjoy it can be a great way to socialise. If you have
        shoulder
        pain it may be best to adjust the way you exercise in the short term. If there is damage, reducing what you do
        with
        that
        part of your body while it heals will enable you to get back to doing everything you want quicker. If you have
        been in
        pain for a while then an approach to challenge your shoulder slowly and progressively may be the best way to get
        your
        shoulder moving again. If that is something that interests you then get in touch.

      <details>
        <summary>When is shoulder pain a heart attack?</summary>
        Mostly shoulder pain is not a heart attack. The most common signs of a heart attack can include chest pain,
        shortness
        of
        breath, sudden sweating, anxiety or sudden feeling of extreme worry, dizziness or sickness. The chest pain can
        spread
        up
        to your shoulder and neck or down to your stomach. Shoulder pain on its own is unlikely to be a heart attack.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is my shoulder pain cancer?</summary>
        <p>
          Mostly shoulder pain is not due to cancer. However, shoulder pain can be associated with a rare cancer in the
          top of the lung. One of the risk factors for this type of cancer is a history of smoking. The pain can be
          constant and not necessarily related to any specific movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain from this type of cancer can be in the shoulder, under the shoulder blade, along the inside of the
          arm and sometimes to the hand. Sometimes this type of cancer can affect the nerves to one side of the face
          causing a drooping eyelid amongst other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are concerned seek medical advice.

        <summary>Shoulder pain relief.</summary>
        <p>
          Through millions of years of evolution our body has developed a brilliant feedback system that tells us when
          we are injured, stimulates healing and motivates us to change our behaviour. One of the outputs of this system
          is pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have injured yourself and are in pain, listen to your body and do what feels good. This may involve
          adjusting how you move for a while. It might mean talking to a friend. It might involve eating your favourite
          food. Ice, heat or painkillers may help. Talk to a pharmacist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the body feedback system doesn’t work in an ideal manner. All sorts of things can affect how we feel
          our body. Stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, bad relationships, bad diet and may other things can make pain
          worse. Think about your life. What do you enjoy? What can you change?
        </p>
        <p>
          That wasn’t the answer you were expecting was it? If you would like some help working out how to get your
          shoulder moving better and reduce your pain, book an appointment.

        <summary>How to fix/treat/reduce shoulder pain?</summary>
        <p>Shoulders are complex. We are all built differently and there are many things that can mean we feel pain in
          our shoulders. If it is a minor injury and not something systemic, movement tends to help. Start small and
          easy and progress slowly to more movement under more load. If the symptoms don’t improve or you are worried
          seek help. If you book an appointment with me I can screen for anything worrying as well as offering specific
          exercises or movements to help you on your road to recovery.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Why does my shoulder click?</summary>
        <p>
          Some peoples bodies make more noises than others. Personally my knees crunch whenever I stand up. There is no
          evidence that having noisy joints has any long term health consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes a joint clicks as the tendon of a muscle flicks over a bit of bone. In such cases it may be that the
          joint needs some different movement to relax the muscle that is causing the noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some people their tissues are more elastic. We all know someone who can bend their fingers back a long way.
          In people whose joints are looser things can feel out of place and need to ‘click’ to feel right again.
          Sometimes strengthening the joint or doing proprioceptive exercises can stop that feeling occurring.
          Proprioceptive exercises are ones that help us know, and have control of, where our shoulder is in space. If
          this is something that you are interested in then book in to have a chat with me.

        <summary>Why is my neck and shoulder pain worse when lying down</summary>
        There are a few reasons that your shoulder pain may be worse when lying down. The most obvious one is that you
        may be
        lying on an area of the shoulder that has been damaged, compressing the tissue and making your pain worse. It
        could be
        that the position your shoulder is in when you lie means that gravity is acting on it differently and that shift
        is
        pulling on a sensitive area, giving you a change in symptoms. A less obvious reason may be that the symptoms you
        are
        experiencing are what is termed ‘referred pain’. Referred pain is when we feel symptoms in one area that come
        from
        another area. An example of this are when we have leg pain associated with back pain. Pain that refers to the
        shoulder
        can come from the neck. It could be that when you lie down your neck is affected, but you feel it in your
        shoulder.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why do I have shoulder pain at night?</summary>
        We often feel pain at night. Sometimes this may be the position we are in or referred pain. See pain in shoulder
        when
        lying down. Another reason may be that we are not doing anything and so are free to pay attention to the pain.
        The
        daily
        cycle of our bodies means that we do a lot of our healing at night. If there is inflammation or damage and we
        are
        awake
        at night, it can make things feel worse.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why do we get shoulder pain in pregnancy?</summary>
        Pregnant women can have shoulder pain just the same as those who are not pregnant. However there are a few
        problems that can occur that may be specific to the pregnancy. Shoulder pain can be one of the symptoms of an
        ectopic pregnancy, and is likely to be accompanied by sharp pains in the abdomen. As the baby grows the
        abdominal organs have to adapt to the reduced space. Problems with the gall bladder or liver can cause shoulder
        symptoms, as can anything that irritates the diaphragm. As the pregnancy progresses the weight gain can lead to
        extra stresses through the body which can lead to small strains and sprains which may affect the shoulder.
