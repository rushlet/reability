      <summary>What to expect from an online consultation</summary>
      <p>Each consultation will involve you telling me about your problem and how it is affecting you, as well as me
        asking questions about you, and your life. Somewhere private, with a good internet signal works best.</p>
      <p>I may need to see you moving or get you to press into different areas of your body. Is there somewhere you
        can put your device, so that your hands are free, and the camera can see the relevant part of you moving?</p>
      <p>I am here to answer your questions and to help you understand what is normal for your situation and what can
        be done to help.</p>
      <p>We can then discuss strategies for self care and come up with a plan. This may involve exercises, stretches
        or other ways to change what is happening to you. We may be able to record you doing these during the
        consultation, or I can send videos or an email explanation afterwards.</p>
      <p>Included in the initial consultation fee is a free follow up, a few days later, to check how you are doing
        and answer any questions that may have come up. Depending on your situation, one appointment might be enough
        for a few weeks, or we might need another appointment in 1-2 weeks.</p>
      <p>Osteopaths are mostly known for treating back pains, however we can treat pain in any joint of the body. I
        have recently become fascinated with treating painful shoulders.</p>
      <p>Whether your issue is new or has been with you for a while, feel free to book now.</p>

        you, as well as me asking questions about you, and your life.</p>
